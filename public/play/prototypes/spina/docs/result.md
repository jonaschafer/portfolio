High-Impact, Low-Maintenance Options
1. Instagram Shop Integration

She already has photos of her work (for markets)
You build: Simple Shopify/Square store + Instagram connection
She posts like normal, tags products, people buy
Handles fulfillment same as markets (packs/ships)
Why this works: Her customers are already on Instagram looking at art

2. Local SEO Domination

You set up: Google Business Profile + simple site
Rank for "[city] custom t-shirts", "[city] local artist"
Most local artists don't even try this
Gets wholesale inquiries from local shops/breweries
Why this works: Zero competition, people searching "near me"

3. Print-on-Demand Backend

You integrate: Printful/Printify to her store
She uploads designs once
They print/ship when ordered
She keeps doing custom/limited at markets
Why this works: Passive income from old designs, no inventory risk

What NOT to Do

Don't build a custom e-commerce site from scratch (overkill)
Don't try to make her "go viral" on TikTok (not sustainable)
Don't do complex dropshipping (she has real products)
Don't make her manage 5 social platforms (she won't)

The 80/20 Setup
You build once:

Shopify/Square store ($29-39/month)
Connect Instagram Shopping (free)
Set up Google Business (free)
Add 3-5 bestsellers to print-on-demand
Simple email collection (15% off first order)

She maintains:

Posts to Instagram when she makes new stuff
Ships orders 1-2x/week
Emails list when at markets nearby

Result: Online presence that works while she's at her day job, feeds leads to in-person sales, creates passive income from designs.
The key is she doesn't need to "compete online" - she needs online to feed her IRL business and create a small passive stream. Her advantage is she's real, local, and makes actual things (vs Redbubble spam).
Want me to spec out the technical setup for any of these?
