# How to Sell Your Art Online (Without Being Tech Savvy)

**Written for:** Artists who sell at farmers markets and want to make more money online  
**Tech level required:** Can send an email  
**Time to set up:** 2-3 hours spread over a weekend  
**Monthly cost:** $29-39 (pays for itself with ~2-3 sales)

---

## Why This Works

You're not trying to compete with massive Etsy shops. You're:
- Making it easy for people who saw you at the market to buy later
- Getting found by locals searching "custom t-shirts near me"
- Creating passive income from your old designs
- Getting wholesale inquiries from local shops

**The secret:** Most local artists don't even try this. Zero competition.

## The Three Things That Actually Work

### 1. Instagram Shopping (Start Here)
### 2. Google Business Profile (Free Local Advertising)
### 3. Print-on-Demand (Passive Income)

Let's do them one at a time.

---

## PART 1: Instagram Shopping Setup

**What this does:** People tap your Instagram photos and buy directly. No leaving the app.

**What you need:**
- Instagram account (you probably have this)
- Business bank account or debit card
- 30 minutes

### Step 1: Pick Your Store Platform

You need a "store" that connects to Instagram. Two options:

**OPTION A: Square Online (Easiest)**
- Go to: squareup.com/us/en/online-store
- Click "Get Started"
- Choose "Free" plan to start
- Create account with your email

**OPTION B: Shopify (Most Popular)**
- Go to: shopify.com
- Click "Start free trial"
- Enter your email
- Choose "I'm just starting" when asked

**Which one?** 
- Already use Square at markets? → Square Online
- Starting fresh? → Shopify (better Instagram connection)

### Step 2: Add Your First Product

**In Square:**
1. Click "Items" in the left menu
2. Click "Create an Item"
3. Add:
   - Item name: "Mountain Landscape T-Shirt - Medium"
   - Price: $28
   - Upload photo (from your phone is fine!)
   - Description: What makes it special
4. Click "Save"

**In Shopify:**
1. Click "Products" 
2. Click "Add product"
3. Fill in:
   - Title: "Mountain Landscape T-Shirt - Medium"
   - Description: What makes it special
   - Price: $28
   - Upload photo
5. Click "Save"

**Pro tip:** Start with your 5 bestsellers from markets. That's it.

### Step 3: Connect to Instagram

**In Square:**
1. Go to "Marketing" → "Instagram"
2. Click "Connect Instagram"
3. Log in to your Instagram
4. Click "Allow" on all the permissions
5. Done!

**In Shopify:**
1. Click "Sales channels" (left side, bottom)
2. Click "+" next to Facebook & Instagram
3. Click "Add sales channel"
4. Click "Connect Account"
5. Log in to Instagram and Facebook
6. Click through all the "Allow" buttons
7. Wait 24-48 hours for approval (Instagram reviews it)

### Step 4: Tag Products in Instagram Posts

**Once approved:**
1. Post a photo like normal on Instagram
2. Before posting, tap "Tag Products"
3. Tap on your product in the photo
4. Search for it by name
5. Select it
6. Post!

**Now what happens:**
- People see your post
- They tap the photo
- They see the price
- They click "View on Website"
- They buy!

---

## PART 2: Google Business Profile (Get Found Locally)

**What this does:** When someone searches "custom t-shirts Portland" or "local artist near me", YOU show up with photos, reviews, and a link.

**Cost:** Free  
**Time:** 20 minutes

### Step 1: Create Your Profile

1. Go to: business.google.com
2. Click "Manage now"
3. Sign in with your Gmail (or create one)
4. Enter your business name (even if it's just "Sarah's Designs")
5. Choose category: "Artist" or "Custom T-Shirt Store"

### Step 2: Choose How Customers Find You

**Question: "Do you want to add a location customers can visit?"**

Pick one:
- **If you sell at home or studio:** Choose "Yes" and enter your address
- **If you only do markets:** Choose "No, I deliver goods and services to my customers"

Then enter your service area (your city or cities where you sell)

### Step 3: Add Contact Info

1. Enter your phone number (Google will text you a code)
2. Enter that code
3. Add your website (your Square/Shopify store URL)
4. Add your Instagram handle

### Step 4: Add Photos

This is IMPORTANT. Add:
- 5-10 photos of your products
- 1-2 photos of you at your booth/workspace
- Cover photo (your logo or best product)

**Why photos matter:** Google shows profiles with photos 2x more often.

### Step 5: Write Your Description

Click "Add business description"

**Template to copy:**
```
Custom illustrated t-shirts, art prints, and unique gifts made by [Your Name]. 
Find me at [City] farmers markets and local artist events. 
Original designs, locally made, supporting local art.
Wholesale inquiries welcome!
```

Keep it under 750 characters.

### Step 6: Post Updates

Every time you're at a market:
1. Open Google Business app on your phone (download it)
2. Tap "Add update"
3. Upload a photo from the market
4. Write: "At [Market Name] this Saturday 9am-2pm! Come say hi!"
5. Post

**Why this works:** Google LOVES fresh content. Do this weekly.

## PART 3: Print-on-Demand (Make Money While You Sleep)

**What this does:** Someone orders your design, a company prints it and ships it, you get paid. Zero work after setup.

**Best for:** Designs that sell well but you're tired of printing

### Step 1: Choose a Print-on-Demand Service

**Printful** (integrates with Shopify/Square)
- Go to: printful.com
- Click "Sign up"
- Choose "I have an online store"
- Connect your Shopify or Square store

### Step 2: Upload a Design

1. In Printful, click "Add Product"
2. Choose product type (t-shirt, hoodie, print, etc.)
3. Choose specific product (Bella Canvas 3001 is popular)
4. Upload your design file
   - **What file?** PNG or JPG, at least 3000x3000 pixels
   - **Don't have high-res?** Take a good photo of your original artwork, or scan it
5. Position it on the mockup
6. Click "Proceed to mockups"

### Step 3: Set Your Price

Printful shows you:
- Their cost: $12.95 (what they charge you)
- Suggested retail: $24.95

**Your profit:** $12 per sale

You can change the retail price. Most artists do $28-32 for t-shirts.

### Step 4: Publish to Your Store

1. Click "Submit to store"
2. Add product title and description
3. Click "Submit"
4. It automatically appears in your Shopify/Square store!

### Step 5: What Happens When Someone Orders

1. Customer orders on your site
2. Printful gets the order automatically
3. They print it (2-3 days)
4. They ship it to customer
5. Money goes to your bank account
6. You get an email notification

**You literally do nothing.**

## Your Maintenance Schedule

**Once everything is set up, here's your weekly routine:**

### Monday (5 minutes)
- Check orders from weekend
- Ship any custom orders

### Wednesday (10 minutes)
- Post to Instagram with product tags
- Share that post to your story

### Friday (5 minutes)
- Post on Google Business about weekend market
- Respond to any messages/questions

### Sunday (15 minutes)
- Review what sold best this week
- Add 1 new product to your store

**That's it.** 35 minutes per week.

---

## What This Costs

### Month 1 (Setup)
- Shopify: Free trial (or Square: Free forever)
- Google Business: Free
- Printful: Free (you only pay when someone orders)
- **Total: $0**

### Month 2+ (Ongoing)
- Shopify: $39/month (or Square: Free, but 2.9% per transaction)
- Google Business: Free
- Printful: Free (they take their cut from each sale)
- **Total: $0-39/month**

### Break-Even
- If you charge $28 for a shirt and make $12 profit (Printful)
- You need 4 sales per month to break even
- Everything after that is pure profit

## Common Questions

### "I don't have a business bank account"
You can use your personal debit card to start. When you're making $500+/month consistently, then get a business account.

### "What about taxes?"
Save 25% of your profits in a separate account. Give that info to your tax person at tax time. (Or use something like TurboTax self-employed)

### "What if someone wants a custom order?"
Message them on Instagram and arrange payment through Venmo/PayPal like you do now. The store is for standard items only.

### "Do I need a business license?"
Depends on your city. Google "[your city] business license requirements". Most cities don't require one until you make $12k+/year.

### "I'm terrible at Instagram"
You don't need to be good. Just post:
- Photos of new products (tag the product)
- Photos from markets (tag your location)
- Behind-the-scenes of you creating

3 posts per week is plenty.

### "What about Etsy?"
You can do Etsy AND this. But this is better because:
- No listing fees
- Lower transaction fees
- You own your customer list
- You're not competing with 1000 other people

### "What if I get overwhelmed?"
Start with JUST Instagram Shopping (Part 1). Do that for a month. Then add Google Business (Part 2). Then add Print-on-Demand (Part 3) when you're ready.

One step at a time.

## Real Example: What This Looks Like

**Sarah sells illustrated plant t-shirts at farmers markets.**

### Before:
- Makes $200-400 per market day
- 2 markets per month = $400-800/month
- Has to be physically there to sell
- Runs out of popular sizes

### After (3 months in):
- Still makes $200-400 per market day
- Sells $600/month online (5-6 orders per week)
- Print-on-demand makes $200/month passive (10 sales)
- Local coffee shop orders 24 wholesale shirts after finding her on Google
- **Total: $1,200-1,600/month** (vs $400-800 before)

**Time invested:** 35 minutes per week after initial setup
