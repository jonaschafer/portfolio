Two guides:

# artist-online-guide.md
For her. Written like you're explaining to your grandma. No jargon, step-by-step screenshots described, builds confidence.

# tech-implementation-guide.md
For you. Technical details, code snippets, automation setup, troubleshooting, exact settings to configure.

The artist guide assumes she can click buttons and that's it. The tech guide assumes you'll do the 3-4 hour initial setup, then she maintains it with 30 min/week.

## Key insight
Don't give her the tech guide. She'll panic. You do the setup, show her the 4 things she needs to do weekly, and let her discover features as she needs them.
