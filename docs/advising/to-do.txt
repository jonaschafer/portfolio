Draft translator positioning (needed for everything else) - Daniel validated this angle heavily, make it central to your pitch
"You become the brand voice in leadership conversations" - You're translating brand implications to non-creative executives
"They need someone who can take 'I want us to feel premium' and turn it into: Here's what that means for your product, your messaging, your hiring" - This is pure translation work
"The value is preventing expensive misalignment" - You translate strategic concepts into financial/operational terms leadership understands
His own positioning: "I help leadership teams think strategically about their creative" - He's not doing creative, he's translating creative thinking for business leaders
Your current pitch ("Strategic brand authority for Series B-C companies") is vague. Daniel's validation suggests sharper positioning:
❌ "I provide strategic brand direction"
✅ "I'm the brand voice in your leadership conversations - translating 'we need to feel premium' into clear product, messaging, and hiring decisions"
The pattern Daniel kept reinforcing: Your value isn't crafting the brand (execution), it's helping non-creative leadership understand brand implications and make informed decisions.
Set your rate range (needed for conversations) - Daniel suggested $200-300/hr, decide where you land based on your experience level
Build discovery process (needed before outreach) - How you'll qualify companies in 1-2 calls before engagement
Create a one-page site with 2-3 case studies - Daniel specifically said "web page or website" with a work gallery, not a traditional portfolio. This is lighter lift than it sounds.
Endorsed brand situation - CEO kept saying "house of brands",  created teaching deck, Result: CEO hired naming agency month later, this is a advisory proof point

Document 2-3 reusable tools you've built (intake systems, brand architecture diagrams, strategic decks)
Create a page from my proposal. Daniel: 
I'd turn this into a web page or website, with either a gallery or carousel of work and maybe a link off to a more in-depth portfolio. From there, we should talk about how you want to approach finding companies to work with. The best routes in my experience are a) finding organic opportunities in your network, and b) building relationships with venture firms to see if they'd be willing to connect you with their portfolio companies.
For A above, I would email the most connected people in your network once you have a site up and announce that you're now open to advising startups — and ask for intros as people see opportunities.For B, I would basically run it like a sales process and get a list of names/email addresses, be comfortable cold emailing them, etc. Not sure if there are any local venture firms in Portland where you can also lean into meeting them in person.
Draft your network announcement email - Daniel said once your site is up, email your most connected people. Write this now so you're ready to send immediately.
Map warm network + VC list
List people who could intro you to Series B-C founders (Daniel's network, your agency contacts, ClassDojo investors)
List venture firms to cold email - Daniel said "run it like a sales process" for VC relationships. Start building this list (Ligature is #1, but identify 5-10 more
One thing Daniel implied but you didn't capture: He said focus on "organic opportunities in your network" first, then VCs second. Your action items don't prioritize this - warm network should come before cold VC outreach.
Shadow Daniel's call (if still valuable)
Draft engagement structure (refine after first client) - What 2-4 hours/month actually looks like (monthly strategy call? Async feedback? Framework workshops?)
Ask Daniel to shadow an advisory call
