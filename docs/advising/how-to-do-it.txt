Discovery

Step 1: Discovery Call (30-45 min)
What you're trying to figure out:
What are their actual pain points right now?
What do they need first vs. later?
Who would you work with (just Head of Design? The CEO? The team?)
What does success look like in 3 months? 6 months?
Budget reality check (do they actually have $8-10k/month?)
Questions to ask:
"Walk me through the rebrand—what's working, what's not?"
"What surfaces need attention first?" (website? product? marketing?)
"Who's on the design team currently?" (are they capable of executing?)
"What would make this engagement successful for you?"
Red flags 🔴🔴
They want 40 hours of work for 10 hours of pay
They're vague about budget
They want you to "fix everything"
Green flags 🟢🟢
They're clear on priorities
They have budget approved
They understand fractional = strategic, not production
They have a plan to hire full-time eventually



Send a Proposal

Don't just "get hired on retainer"—send a proper proposal. Here's why:
Forces you to think through scope (what you WILL and WON'T do)
Sets expectations (they won't expect 40 hours of work)
Protects you (you can point back to it when scope creeps)
Looks professional (you're not desperate, you're a consultant)
Gives them something to get approved (they need to run it by their boss/finance)
What to include:
(Keep it 2-3 pages max. Should be able to read in 5 mins)

NEXT STEPS
If this looks good, I'll send a simple consulting agreement and we can kick off [date].





Contract

Use a basic consulting agreement. You can find templates online or ask Daniel for his. Key clauses:
Services: "Fractional Creative Director services as outlined in attached SOW"
Payment: "$X/month, due on 1st of month, net 15"
Term: "6 months starting [date], renewable"
Termination: "Either party may terminate with 30 days written notice"
IP: "All work product belongs to Client"
Confidentiality: Standard NDA language
Independent Contractor: "Contractor is not an employee"
Don't:
Overthink it
Use a 20-page contract
Negotiate for weeks
Ask for equity (keep it simple on your first one)


Kick off

Your first month is discovery and alignment:
Week 1: Stakeholder Interviews
Talk to CEO, Head of Product, Head of Marketing, anyone else relevant
Understand their POV on the brand
Learn what's working and what's not
Week 2: Current State Audit
Review all brand touchpoints (website, product, marketing, emails, etc.)
Document what's inconsistent, what's missing, what's broken
Take screenshots and organize in Figma or Notion
Week 3: Priorities Mapping
Based on interviews + audit, create a prioritized roadmap
What needs attention NOW vs. LATER
Get alignment with leadership
Week 4: First Deliverable
Could be: strategic direction doc, brand principles, redesign of one key surface
Something tangible they can react to




Tips

Time tracking:
Track your hours honestly (even if you go over, you'll learn)
Don't nickel-and-dime (a 15-min Slack thread isn't billable)
If you consistently go over 15 hours, raise it in month 2
Communication:
Set expectations early (response time, availability, meeting cadence)
Use async as much as possible (Loom videos, Figma comments, Google Docs)
Be clear when you're "on" vs. "off"
Scope creep:
It WILL happen on your first gig
When it does, say: "Happy to do that, but it's outside our current scope. Want to add it for next month?"
Don't be a pushover, but also don't be rigid on your first one
Managing contractors:
If you need to bring someone in, add 20% to their rate for your management
Example: Contractor costs $100/hr, you charge them $120/hr
Make it clear in the proposal: "Contractor costs billed at cost + 20% management fee"
Monthly check-ins:
End of each month: "Here's what we accomplished, here's what's next, here's where we stand on hours"
Gives them visibility, builds trust
