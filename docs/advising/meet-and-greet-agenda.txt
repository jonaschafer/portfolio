# meet and greet agenda

Thanks for meeting! 

Just to set the stage - I'm a Creative Director at ClassDojo looking to start taking on 1-2 clients over the year. My manager is fully supportive - wild - so I'm trying to figure out the tactical side, like what the work looks like in practice since the hours are presumably limited and to do great work you’d need either more time or people. 

I think you mentioned you’ve done this once over and are exploring it more. Is that right? 

What does a typical engagement actually look like month-to-month?
How many hours do you agree to a month? Week?
Is it like a retainer, you have a set # of hours or is it scoped (by your or them)?
How much of it is strategic - sharing your experience, creating docs, decks - vs producing work?
How involved do you get with their team? (Do you attend meetings, review work, train people?)
How do you give tough feedback without damaging the relationship?

If you’re game, curious about rates
Hourly, project-based, monthly retainer?
Equity, like Ximena? 
You mentioned the client is like “where do I find people like you” - curious if there are any resources you tapped to help you figure this out? 

Challenges
What surprised you most about advisory work vs. full-time?
What's harder than you expected?
How do you balance advisory work with other commitments?

My goals
Honestly, I want to get out of my bubble and see how different companies tackle the same problems. At ClassDojo I'm solving the same set of challenges over and over—doing advisory work would let me see patterns I'd never see staying in one place. Plus I love working with founders who have a vision but can't quite articulate it yet, helping them get it out of their head and into something real.
What gets me excited is taking early-stage chaos—like right after a rebrand or when they're figuring out their first product—and turning it into systems that actually scale. Not just one-off designs, but frameworks their team can run with after I'm gone. That big picture/little details thing, where you're thinking strategically but also obsessing over craft.
