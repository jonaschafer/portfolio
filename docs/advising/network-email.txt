Subject: Now advising startups on brand strategy

Hey [Name],
Quick update: I'm now taking on fractional advisory work with Seed-Series B companies that need strategic brand direction but aren't ready for a full-time CD.

Think: translating "we need to feel premium" into clear product, messaging, and hiring decisions. The brand voice in leadership conversations.

If you know any founders dealing with unclear brand direction, recent rebrands, or first creative hires—I'd love an intro.
