# Daniel Takeaways

Q1 (What activities/how to avoid execution): ✅ Fully answered - He gave specific examples:
Strategic feedback on creative work (reviewing decks, giving verbal direction)
Building frameworks (your "branded house" moment is a perfect example)
Education/translation work (helping founders understand brand concepts)
His key insight: "You're not doing the work, you're helping them think about it differently"
Q2 (Shadow a call): ❌ Not answered - Notes don't mention this. Follow up if you still want this.
Q3 (Pitch reaction): ✅ Indirectly answered - He validated the concept through:
"Companies at that stage have money but not clarity" (confirms your B-C targeting)
His own positioning focuses on strategic thinking, not execution
The "translator" role he described matches your pitch
Q4 (Advisory portfolio): ✅ Strongly answered - His advice:
Don't create a portfolio upfront
Lead with specific case studies/moments (like your "branded house" example)
Portfolio emerges from actual client work
Focus on demonstrable expertise through teaching/frameworks
Missing from your questions but he offered:
Pricing guidance (his range: $200-300/hr for strategic work)
Time commitment realities (2-4 hours/month per client)
How clients actually find him (warm intros, not cold outreach)

# Kacey takeawways
Takeaways


Record via Granola, generated by Claude (takeaways and action items)
Mindset shifts
It's messier than you think: Kacey "barely does anything," it's organic, client is green
It's more teaching than making: Coaching green clients, providing courage/language
Relationships > cold outreach: Hover rejected fractional pitch, but Kacey got in through partner's wife through VC
Don't overthink the title: She called it "advisory" but admits it's not really advising
Series B-C is sweet spot: Too small for full-time CD, too busy for zero creative help
Immediate (This Week):
Tell Daniel about Kacey conversation - mention:
She got his May email, still interested
She works fractionally now
Could be good ClassDojo connection or Ligature portfolio company fit
Follow up with Daniel on your next convo - ask specifically:
What activities would advisory actually look like for design/brand?
How does he evaluate which portfolio companies need design advisory?
That deck you made about endorsed brands - is that the type of work?
Reframe Hover opportunity (if still relevant):
Not "I could tell you what you need"
More like "I work with early-stage companies on brand strategy alongside my CD role - happy to explore if fractional makes sense for you"
Short-term (This Month):
Document your "endorsed brand" approach as a case study:
CEO kept saying "house of brands"
You created teaching deck
Result: CEO hired naming agency month later
This is your advisory proof point
Create your positioning:
Based on Kacey: DON'T call it "fractional" or "advisory" if you're doing hands-on work
Based on your strength: "Strategic brand authority for Series B-C companies"
Your sweet spot: Translating CEO vision into actual brand strategy (what you did with endorsed brands)
Build list of potential clients via:
Ligature portfolio companies (when Daniel opens that door)
Series B-C companies doing rebrands
Companies with green marketing leaders who need coaching
Medium-term (Next 3 Months):
Test your fractional intake system with someone:
You built that automated system
Kacey's friends said "sell that thing"
Could be your entry point: "I help small teams build their intake process" → builds trust → "now let's talk about your brand"
Study Daniel's model more:
Ligature = funding + design advisory bundled
How does he structure those relationships?
What does he actually deliver month-to-month?
Can you shadow one of his advisory calls?
Connect with other fractional designers:
Kacey's actively looking too
Share learnings
Figure out realistic rates together




What a typical engagement looks like:
Structure & Hours:
No set hours discussed upfront - operates organically ("hey can you think of ideas?" → comes back in a few days)
Very casual, as-needed basis rather than structured retainer
Set expectation early: "I have other clients, you're not my only priority"
Type of Work:
Started as high-level creative team for campaign ideas (out-of-home campaign for funding round)
Evolved into: giving feedback on product marketing videos, ideation for launches, connecting them to other creatives (motion designers, editors)
Key insight: Client is Series C - too early for full-time creative director but has brand creative needs
Her honest take: "I barely do anything" - it runs in the background, client understands she has other work
Strategic vs. Production:
Mix of both, but acted as: creative directors, account managers, print producers
Created "a little agency" for the OOH campaign
Significant coaching/teaching component - client is green, over her head, needs courage to take risks
Provides "emotional support" and language/materials to sell ideas internally
Challenges & Surprises:
What it actually is:
"It's not really advising because they're not asking us to advise - we're working in a more practical sense"
More like part-time work than pure advisory
Very relationship-based (partner's wife connected them to founder through PR work)
Client management reality:
Marketing director doesn't understand brand work, has e-commerce background
Asks for "pie in the sky ideas" then comes back with "$50k gift for product launch"
"Without ever making them feel stupid, but also educating them"
Rates & Business Model:
Didn't discuss specific rates
No equity mentioned in her situation
Trying to replicate this as "base layer under day rate jobs"
Sees it as lucrative if you can get a couple clients
How She Found It:
Through relationships (partner's wife who was consulting there)
Wife was connected to founder through a VC
Now actively trying to replicate by:
Reaching out to other fractional workers
Deep on LinkedIn
Connecting with CMOs and fractional CMOs (they bring in creative help)
Trying to connect with VCs (they know founders, can make recommendations)
Her Interest in Your Situation:
Super interested in Daniel/Ligature VC model
Wants to connect with VCs who fund startups (source of referrals)
Got cold email from Daniel in May 2024 about ClassDojo brand refresh (you should follow up on this!)
