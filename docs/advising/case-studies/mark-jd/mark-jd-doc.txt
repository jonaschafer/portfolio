Mark’s JD

Problem
Mark's caught between worlds - too product-minded for brand, too brand-involved for product, exceptional at systems but can disappear into rabbit holes, not interested in a brand title. 

Solution
Formalize his role and responsibilities

—-


[DRAFT]

Design Systems Lead, Brand Studio
Reports to: Head of Creative (Daniel Scrivner)

Pro: marketable title, clear scope/boundaries
Con: doesn’t immediately signal ‘creative’ responsibility

Alt: Design Technologist
Pro: captures his strength with tools/AI/prototyping, very marketable, implies technical depth
Con: not clear the creative/brand collaboration aspect 



As Design Systems Lead, you own the scalable foundations that power Dojo's brand(s) and product(s) experiences across web, email, app, and marketing touchpoints (MDS, PDS, EDS). You explore creative execution and contribute ideas, but primarily translate brand direction into functional, maintainable systems that teams can use confidently. You're the bridge between creative vision and technical reality, bringing expertise in interaction design, prototyping, animation, AI tooling, and cross-functional collaboration.

Your work elevates the entire Dojo brand: interaction design and accessibility aren't afterthoughts, they're the standard. Your execution is a delight to use - the kind of experience people share.



What you own
Design Systems (MDS, PDS, EDS)
Evolution, documentation, and tooling
Component library architecture and maintenance
Design tokens, patterns, and guidelines
Animation principles and tokens across platforms
Web System Architecture
Interaction patterns and component behavior
Animation systems and micro-interactions
Responsive patterns and technical implementation
Design-to-engineering handoff and collaboration
Cross-System Stewardship
Product Design System (PDS) liaison and alignment
Email Design System (EDS) evolution and consistency
Marketing Design System (MDS) evolution and consistency
Resolving conflicts between systems - you make the call
Ensuring brand coherence across all three systems
Design Operations & Tooling
AI and automation efficiencies for design workflows
Prototyping tools and technical exploration
Identifying and implementing new tools/approaches
Technical problem-solving for brand execution


How to contribute to brand stuff
You participate in brand projects as a systems-thinking partner and executor. You explore creative approaches, contribute interaction ideas, and help brainstorm execution - but your primary role is translating concepts into functional, animated, production-ready work. You take projects from 70% creative direction to 100% shippable reality through systemization, interaction design, and technical implementation.
You will:
Jam on execution approaches during early exploration
Propose, iterate and finalize interaction patterns or animation ideas
Prototype concepts to test feasibility
Be the systems-informed voice in creative discussions
You don't:
Lead brand strategy or concepting
Design core brand identity elements
Own campaign creative direction
Drive early-stage creative exploration without clear direction

Success is…
In 6 months:
MDS is documented, maintained, and usable by non-designers and engineers
Web updates ship faster and more consistently through systematic approach
Brand concepts translate into functional, animated, systematic reality with minimal hand-off
You know when to timebox exploration vs. go deep on technical execution
Cross-functional partners (product, eng, marketing) know when and how to involve you
In 1 year:
Leading systems thinking across the organization, not just within brand studio
MDS adoption is measurable and growing
You've identified and implemented AI/tooling efficiencies that save team time
Clear patterns exist for how brand work flows through systems

Growth areas
Scoping & Timeboxing: Knowing when "good enough" unblocks progress vs. when depth matters. Timeboxing unknowns and nice-to-haves before diving deep.
Systems Leadership: Expanding influence and systems thinking across the broader organization

Why this makes sense
You've been at ClassDojo for 6+ years and understand the product deeply. You have strong relationships across product, engineering, and marketing - making you an effective bridge between these worlds. You're energized by technical problem-solving, interaction design, and building systems that empower others. You're vocal about how you work best and are proactive about managing your focus. While you're not interested in becoming a pure brand designer, you care deeply about craft and bringing creative work to life through systematic, technical excellence.
