"How We Work" Page Overview
The "How We Work" page (/how-we-work) is a comprehensive internal guide that explains the Brand Studio team's processes and sets expectations. Here's what it includes:
Main Sections:
Overview - Key facts:
Submit requests via intake form
Weekly reviews on Mondays
2+ weeks minimum turnaround
Capacity - Live workload visibility:
Shows real-time active projects from Asana (pulls via API)
Visual capacity status (Optimal: 6 projects, Stretched: 7-8, Overloaded: 9+)
Heat-mapped project cards showing size (XS/S/M/L/XL) with color coding
Grid or list view toggle
Shows trade-offs at each capacity level (quality, turnaround time, team health)
Timing - Timeline expectations:
Why 2-week minimum exists
Interactive workback schedule slider (2 weeks = 1 design round, 3+ weeks = multiple rounds)
Copy review calendar (Richard reviews Mondays/Fridays only)
DACI - Decision-making framework:
Clarifies who approves what on the requester side
Prevents "surprise approvers" appearing in round 5
Feedback - How to give effective feedback:
"Critique vs Reaction" model examples
Shows good feedback (problem-based, goal-aligned, user-grounded)
Shows unhelpful feedback (vague, unanchored comparisons)
File Organization - Figma structure:
How files are organized (messy working pages → early rounds → final)
Link to Marketing projects in Figma
FAQ - Common questions:
What if it's urgent?
Can we skip the intake form?
How to check project status
What happens with scope changes
What It Does:
It solves problems #16 ("No central source of truth") and #17 ("No clear place to learn how we work") from the 25 problems. It's essentially a living knowledge base that shows real-time capacity and sets boundaries transparently.
Would you like to include this in the article? It could fit in "The solutions we built" section as another example of the system beyond just the intake form.
