# Case Study: Translating "Make It Iconic" Into Strategic Brand Architecture

## The Problem

My role at ClassDojo came with two persistent challenges: Sam, the CEO, repeatedly left inactionable feedback like "make it iconic," "see Stripe," or "make it trustworthy." But the phrase that appeared most in Figma comments, Slack threads, and weekly reviews was mildly alarming: "we need to be a house of brands."

The underlying issue wasn't bad communication—it was a lack of understanding about what makes good feedback and the implications of that brand architecture model. A bit of context: ClassDojo, owned by Dojo, has five products: ClassDojo, Dojo Sparks, Dojo Islands, Dojo Tutor, and Dojo Plus. All use "Dojo" in their names, share illustration styles and characters, and use similar typefaces and color systems. Yet Sam kept pushing for something the existing structure couldn't deliver—completely standalone brands with no connection.

Before my arrival, the brand team had either ignored the feedback or attempted literal interpretations, creating divergent directions before reverting back. Without understanding brand architecture models or how to give actionable feedback, the team was designing in the dark.

## The Approach

I tackled both problems simultaneously. For the feedback issue, I created a framework teaching the difference between critique (problem-based, goal-aligned, user-grounded) and reaction (vague, unanchored comparisons, subjective). I shared it with Sam, pointed to it in project threads, and eventually rolled it out company-wide since marketing—our biggest requestor—gave similar feedback. While hard to measure, I noticed a sea change: instead of "see WhatsApp," Sam became much more specific, like "this works for our brand today, but in the not-too-distant future we want to go after higher education. How can we build the brand to flex to that audience?"

For the architecture issue, I treated "house of brands" not as aesthetic feedback but as a strategic gap. I searched Slack, Google Docs, Asana, and Figma for every instance Sam used the phrase. I interviewed the team, CMO, and marketing. I discovered that during a previous agency rebrand of the parent company, Sam had raised the same concern—and it was never addressed.

My research revealed that Sam wasn't actually describing a brand architecture problem—he was describing a visual design problem. He wanted each product to feel distinct and memorable while maintaining connection, whereas the brands all kinda blended together. Before I joined, ClassDojo was well-built, but Dojo Tutor, for example, had no character, color system, identity system, or anything really to make it memorable and meaningful. So when he said "house of brands" he really meant having a robust identity for each product.

I prepared for the right moment: a project where Sam had left "house of brands" feedback. Instead of another conversation about what he meant, I created a strategic deck explaining brand architecture models and what they mean for ClassDojo.

## What I Built

**The education:** I showed Sam three models—House of Brands (Procter & Gamble, where Charmin and Duracell never live in the same world), Branded House (FedEx, where everything shares the parent name), and Endorsed Model (a long-term evolution where products become "Sparks by Dojo" with subtle parent brand presence).

I used analogies he understood: "We're not Procter & Gamble where brands are intentionally independent. We're building toward something more like how Pixar films each have distinct identities but share a universe." I explained how our mission requires a connected system—a House of Brands would weaken the trust we've built.

**The strategy:** I argued that ClassDojo currently sits between Branded House and Endorsed Model, and proposed a multi-year plan: remove "Dojo" from prominent positions, rename products like "Sparks" (which isn't ownable), hire a world-class naming agency, and ultimately rebrand with a proper agency. I framed the endorsed model as the path to "iconic"—distinct products that ladder up to a recognizable universe.

**The framework:** I created a "volume knob" concept—every brand decision considers audience (students vs. district admins), surface (Times Square billboard vs. Zoom banner), and context (webinar vs. product). This gave the team a systematic way to make "how loud should this be?" decisions without subjective arguments.

## The Impact

The immediate reaction was clarification and vocal understanding. But the long-term impact emerged over months. Sam started using "endorsed model" in Figma comments, then Slack, then company all-hands. A few months later, he initiated conversations with a world-renowned naming agency (Lexicon) about working together. He shared articles about corporate renamings. When Daniel noted that doing this right would require 1-2% of operating budget, Sam heard us, understood, and made an informed decision to defer the full rebrand by a year while approving the internal work we'd already done.

**Organizational shift:** The framework transformed how the team presents work. Instead of defending aesthetic choices, we now say "we made this change so each brand stands out while laddering up to the Dojo universe." Sam's feedback evolved from "look at Stripe" to specific, actionable questions like "this works for K-12, but how do we build the brand to flex to higher education?"

**Strategic foundation:** By naming the architecture problem, I gave the organization a shared language and multi-year roadmap. The team now has explicit permission to differentiate products while maintaining connection. Most importantly, we stopped trying to achieve "iconic" through design alone and started building the infrastructure to earn it through product quality and consistency over time.

## What This Demonstrates

This case study exemplifies how I help founders translate brand instincts into executable decisions:

**Strategic diagnosis over design solutions:** Rather than iterating on visuals, I identified that "house of brands" was actually a request for distinct product identities within a connected system. The real problem wasn't the architecture model—it was the lack of robust identity systems for each product.

**Education as leadership:** I built Sam's fluency in brand architecture by connecting abstract models to familiar examples and our specific context, while simultaneously teaching the organization how to give feedback that leads to great work. This wasn't about winning an argument—it was about creating shared understanding so he could make informed strategic decisions.

**Long-term thinking:** I proposed a multi-year roadmap with clear milestones (naming agency, rebrand partner, budget allocation) rather than quick fixes. The endorsed model gives the organization a north star even if full execution is years away.

**Measurable outcomes:** Sam's feedback quality improved dramatically. The phrase "endorsed model" became organizational vocabulary. A world-class naming agency engagement moved from abstract desire to budgeted initiative. Most importantly, the creative team gained strategic authority to say "here's why this decision supports our architecture."

This is the approach I bring to creative direction: identifying when founder feedback signals strategic gaps rather than aesthetic preferences, building frameworks that translate instinct into systems, and creating infrastructure that elevates both the work and the conversation around it.
