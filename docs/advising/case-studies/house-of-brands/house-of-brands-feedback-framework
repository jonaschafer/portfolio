How to give feedback that leads to great work
(Using the “Critique vs Reaction” model, popularized by Apple, IDEO and leaders like Scott Belsky)

TL;DR → Clear, goal-aligned, descriptive feedback helps us move faster and create stronger work. 

The best creative feedback is

✅ Problem-based
“I’m not clear on what I should focus on here.”
“This element is getting lost—can we give it more visual weight?”

✅ Goal-aligned
“This needs to feel more trustworthy for [product, audience].”
“We want this moment to feel emotionally resonant for kids—how can we get there?”

✅ User- or brand-grounded
“Would a parent understand what they’re supposed to do on this page?”
“This feels too serious for Dojo Sparks’ tone—can we bring back more of the joy/playfulness here?”

What’s not helpful
⚠️ Vague
“I don’t love it” (without saying why)
“This feels off” (without context or goal misalignment)
“It’s not trustworthy.” (subjective) 

⚠️ Unanchored comparisons
“See [Saas brand]”
“[Saas brand] does this well” 
(Unless we can name what is working and why it applies to our goals or audience)

Brand team will…
Always present a clear rationale behind design decisions
Communicate the problem we’re trying to solve n’ the tradeoffs we considered
Be open/flexible to change direction if the project goals shift
