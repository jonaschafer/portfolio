Jon
Hits pause on other projects, focuses fully on ClassDojo brand development in service of
Remaining pages
AH deck
Wall of Love ticket
Overlap with Canva

And wrap up remaining work bc I have context:
AI intake thingee
Merch projects, Districts and ITT

Mark
Wraps up design token stuff, then hits pause and focuses fully on Districts templates. This work will involve a fair bit of systemization which Mark crushes. 

Approach
Gather all context from stakeholders - copy, context, constraints, etc
Blog - Is it still important? If yes: update theme, create blog direction
Paid Ads/Social - What is the exact content? Will that change? 
Email graphics - What will we most likely market on emails? Just UI? 
Explore solutions (for all needs), Fin as benchmark
Finalize, get in production-mode, ready for Figma
Systematize - how should folks use it? 
Example: export any feature UI image


❇️ = Design system/kit must-haves regardless of ask/immediate need (e.g. it will unblock them/us)
