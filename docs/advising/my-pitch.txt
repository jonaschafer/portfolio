Proposal (my pitch to people)
Feb 3, 2026

🔻= Limited experience
Fractional Creative Director
I turn early-stage chaos into brands people remember. 

What I do
Establish brand foundations
Partner with leadership to define brand strategy, positioning, and voice
Build visual identities that work across product and marketing
Create systems that scale (not one-off designs)

Build and structure creative teams
🔻Help you hire your first designer or creative lead
Set up processes, workflows, and design operations
Define what "good" looks like for your company

Navigate critical brand moments
Post-rebrand translation and rollout
Product launches and major features
Preparing brand assets for fundraising

Be the brand authority in the room
Partner with leadership on unclear feedback or direction
Make strategic calls on what to pursue (and what not to)
Give you confidence in creative decisions

Who this is for
Early-stage companies (Seed to Series B) who:
Just rebranded and need help translating it across surfaces
Are hiring their first creative person and need guidance
Have a CEO/founder who knows what they want but can't articulate it
Need strategic brand thinking but don't need (or can't afford) full-time

You're a good fit if:
You value craft and don't want "good enough"
You're building for the long-term, not just quick wins
You want a partner who challenges assumptions, not just takes orders
You're comfortable with someone who's both strategic AND hands-on

How it works
Depending on your situation, I have 3 different approaches but my default approach is strategic direction with external execution. This model is 15-20 hours/month for 6-12 months at $10-$15k/month

What I do
Lead strategic direction and creative decisions
Art direct all brand deliverables
Bring in trusted contractors for execution-heavy work (I manage them)
Review, QA, and ensure everything meets the standard

What you get
Monthly strategic sessions with leadership (design reviews, roadmapping, feedback)
Art direction on brand deliverables (guidelines, systems, key surfaces)
Async feedback on key projects and decisions
Access for critical moments (🔻hiring, launches, 🔻fundraising prep)
Processes and frameworks your team can run with

Typical outcomes
Brand guidelines that actually get used
Design systems built for your specific needs
Website and product surfaces that reflect the brand
A team that knows what "good" looks like

Think of it this way: I'm the creative director, not the production team. I own the strategy and direction, manage the execution, and ensure everything is excellent. You get the deliverables without paying for a full-time CD.
Alternate approaches
Pure advisory
If you already have a strong internal team or work with an agency
Strategic guidance only, zero execution
I review, critique, approve—but don't build
5-10 hours/month, $5-8k/month

Strategic Direction Only
If you have design resources but need leadership
I define what needs to be built (scope, principles, examples)
Your team or agency executes it
I review and give feedback
10-15 hours/month, $8-10k/month

About me
I've spent 22+ years wearing every hat—designer, animator, manager, program lead, fabricator—across agencies like Nike, RGA, and AKQA, plus startups (Clockwise, Duro) and larger tech (Zapier, ClassDojo) companies. I know how to build brands from 0→1 and scale them through rapid growth.

A few of my principles
I lose sleep if I don't have a plan
Good ideas get better after a few conversations
Perfect might be the enemy of the good, but good enough rarely is
If it isn't excellent, why the hell are we doing it?

Recent work:
Clockwise: Led full rebrand from strategy through launch. 29% increase in search visibility, 600+ reactivations on launch day.
Novo: Refreshed visual identity and redesigned marketing site. 3% increase in engagement, NPS rose from 9 to 32.
ClassDojo: Current Creative Director for a 150-person edtech company. Strategic brand partner to CEO.



Next Steps
If this sounds like what you need, let's talk. I'll ask about your current challenges, what you're building, and whether fractional makes sense for you.

Not sure if you need this? Here are some signals:
Your team debates design decisions without a clear voice
You're about to hire your first creative person and don't know where to start
You just rebranded and don't know how to roll it out
Your CEO gives feedback like "make it pop" or "I'll know it when I see it"
