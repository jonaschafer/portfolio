Advisor goal
Jan 7, 2026

Sent to Daniel, my manager:

Hey man! Coming back to our convo about goals. You've mentioned two things that feel connected:
Your goal for me: lead more strategically, less in the weeds, more player/coach (100% agree)
Potentially advising with Ligature companies (mentioned during our CO offsite)

Here's the connection:: a lot of the strategic work I do here is already advisory in nature, like:
Navigating Sam conversations we’ve been having lately
Being the brand ‘voice’ in the room
Making strategic calls on what we should (or shouldn't) pursue (like my audit)

Doing advisory work outside of ClassDojo would give me more chances to see patterns across different contexts and sharpen my judgment faster than staying in one environment. I think that learning would directly strengthen how I show up here. 

How it’d work
One 1:1 per month (30 mins), separate from our regular check-ins, and when work allows. I’ll bring 2-3 questions, you share your experience, I jot down takeaways and/or action items on how I can apply it here at ClassDojo. 

Example Qs
How do you evaluate which companies/founders are worth your time?
What do founders actually need from design advisors vs. what they think they need?
How do you give strategic feedback without getting pulled into execution?
How did you build relationships that led to inbound advisory requests?
How do you structure advisory engagements? (contracts, scope, pricing)

How we measure progress
I'm applying what I learn here (better strategic conversations, clearer POV with Sam)
I can articulate how I'd advise a company on a specific problem (not just generic "make it better")
In 6 months: I have a clear pitch for what I offer as an advisor
In 12 months: I've advised 1 company (maybe through Ligature, maybe independently)

But…
If after 3 sessions this doesn't feel productive or it's pulling too much of your time, let's just kill it, no bigs. What do you think? Totally open to approach here.
